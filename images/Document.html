            <p class="description">
              The concept of well-being or wellness first appeared in the 1950s.
              This concept expanded in the 1970s to encompass the three major
              components of physical, mental, and social well-being.

          <div class="text-box">
            <h5 class="subtitle">1980s</h5>
            <p class="description">
              By the 1980s, the concept of well-being had evolved even further,
              beginning to incorporate elements of spiritual well-being as well.
              This was a reflection of a growing cultural understanding that
              true wellness extends beyond just the physical, mental, and social
              aspects of our lives. An emphasis on personal growth and
              self-actualization began to permeate the concept of well-being.

            <p class="description">
              Fast forward to the 2000s, and the concept of well-being had
              started to include environmental wellness too. As awareness about
              the state of our planet grew, people began to understand that
              individual and societal well-being is deeply connected to the
              health of our environment. This led to a more holistic view of
              well-being that takes into account our relationship with the
              natural world.

                The understanding of wellbeing in <br />
                ancient Greece was predicated upon the <br />
                value given to the balance among the <br />
                body, mind, and spirit. This perspective would have permeated
                throughout the society of that time. <br />
                In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, not only physical health but
                also mental and <br />
                spiritual health were considered vital. For them, the body,
                mind, and spirit were not separate entities but interconnected
                and interactive aspects of the human <br />
                experience, which shaped their approach <br />
                to human health and happiness.
                <br />
                They held a belief that true wellbeing <br />
                could only be achieved when the body, <br />
                mind, and spirit were in harmony. This perspective would have
                been widely accepted across all strata of society, profoundly
                influencing their lifestyle, decision-making processes, and
                value system.

                <p class="description">
                  In ancient Greece, 'wellbeing' was a concept that emphasized
                  the balance of body, mind, and spirit. This was a primary
                  focus for people of that era in enhancing their quality of
                  life. This understanding was deeply rooted in their daily
                  lives, social structures, and even religion.

                <p class="description">
                  However, Hippocrates expanded this original concept in a more
                  concrete and practical direction. He reinterpreted 'wellbeing'
                  not merely as the balance of body, mind, and spirit in an
                  ideal state, but as 'diet, exercise, and rest', practical
                  methods of maintaining health.

                  Interpretation
                </h2>
                <p class="description">
                  Hippocrates' approach provided an opportunity for the people
                  of ancient Greece to gain a more tangible and specific
                  understanding of 'wellbeing'. In this way, he brought the
                  concept of 'wellbeing' down from an ideal state to practical
                  life, providing practical methodologies necessary for people
                  to take responsibility for and manage their health. This could
                  be seen as an innovative expansion of the understanding of
                  'wellbeing' in ancient Greece.
