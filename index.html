                The concept of well-being or wellness first appeared in the
                1950s. This concept expanded in the 1970s to encompass the three
                major components of physical, mental, and social well-being.

              <p class="description show">
                In ancient Greece, 'wellbeing' was a concept that emphasized the
                balance of body, mind, and spirit. This was a primary focus for
                people of that era in enhancing their quality of life. This
                understanding was deeply rooted in their daily lives, social
                structures, and even religion.

              <h3 class="title">Hippocrates' Approach</h3>
              <p class="description show">
                However, Hippocrates expanded this original concept in a more
                concrete and practical direction. He reinterpreted 'wellbeing'
                not merely as the balance of body, mind, and spirit in an ideal
                state, <br />
                but as 'diet, exercise, and rest', practical methods of
                maintaining health.

              <h3 class="title">The Impact of Hippocrates' Interpretation</h3>
              <p class="description show">
                Hippocrates' approach provided an opportunity for the people of
                ancient Greece to gain a more tangible and specific
                understanding of 'wellbeing'. In this way, he brought the
                concept of 'wellbeing' down from an ideal state to practical
                life, providing practical methodologies necessary for people to
                take responsibility for and manage their health. This could be
                seen as an innovative expansion of the understanding of
                'wellbeing' in ancient Greece.

          <h3 class="title">Modern Understanding of Personal Well-being</h3>
          <p class="description">
            The modern concept of well-being encompasses a variety of elements
            that contribute to the improvement of an individual's quality of
            life. Beyond physical health, mental well-being, emotional
            stability, and job satisfaction are recognized as important
            components. Mental well-being refers to the ability to manage stress
            and adapt to changes, while emotional stability represents the
            capacity to navigate life's emotional ups and downs. Furthermore,
            job satisfaction indicates the sense of fulfillment and achievement
            derived from one's profession.

          <p class="description">
            Social connectivity, intellectual development, and environmental
            well-being also form integral parts of the contemporary concept of
            well-being. Social connectivity implies communication and a sense of
            belonging, as well as mutual support. Intellectual development
            denotes continuous learning and personal growth. Lastly,
            environmental well-being pertains to living in a healthy and safe
            environment, which significantly impacts our physical and mental
            well-being. All these elements constitute the modern understanding
            of well-being, contributing to the enhancement of an individual's
            quality of life.
