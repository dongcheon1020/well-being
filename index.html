                The concept of well-being or wellness first appeared in the
                1950s. This concept expanded in the 1970s to encompass the three
                major components of physical, mental, and social well-being.

              <p class="description">
                By the 1980s, the concept of well-being had evolved even
                further, beginning to incorporate elements of spiritual
                well-being as well. This was a reflection of a growing cultural
                understanding that true wellness extends beyond just the
                physical, mental, and social aspects of our lives. An emphasis
                on personal growth and self-actualization began to permeate the
                concept of well-being.

              <p class="description">
                Fast forward to the 2000s, and the concept of well-being had
                started to include environmental wellness too. As awareness
                about the state of our planet grew, people began to understand
                that individual and societal well-being is deeply connected to
                the health of our environment. This led to a more holistic view
                of well-being that takes into account our relationship with the
                natural world.

                  The understanding of wellbeing in <br />
                  ancient Greece was predicated upon the <br />
                  value given to the balance among the <br />
                  body, mind, and spirit. This perspective would have permeated
                  throughout the society of that time. <br />
                  In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, not only physical health
                  but also mental and <br />
                  spiritual health were considered vital. For them, the body,
                  mind, and spirit were not separate entities but interconnected
                  and interactive aspects of the human <br />
                  experience, which shaped their approach <br />
                  to human health and happiness.
                  <br />
                  They held a belief that true wellbeing <br />
                  could only be achieved when the body, <br />
                  mind, and spirit were in harmony. This perspective would have
                  been widely accepted across all strata of society, profoundly
                  influencing their lifestyle, decision-making processes, and
                  value system.

                  <p class="description">
                    In ancient Greece, 'wellbeing' was a concept that emphasized
                    the balance of body, mind, and spirit. This was a primary
                    focus for people of that era in enhancing their quality of
                    life. This understanding was deeply rooted in their daily
                    lives, social structures, and even religion.

                  <p class="description">
                    However, Hippocrates expanded this original concept in a
                    more concrete and practical direction. He reinterpreted
                    'wellbeing' not merely as the balance of body, mind, and
                    spirit in an ideal state, but as 'diet, exercise, and rest',
                    practical methods of maintaining health.

                  <p class="description">
                    Hippocrates' approach provided an opportunity for the people
                    of ancient Greece to gain a more tangible and specific
                    understanding of 'wellbeing'. In this way, he brought the
                    concept of 'wellbeing' down from an ideal state to practical
                    life, providing practical methodologies necessary for people
                    to take responsibility for and manage their health. This
                    could be seen as an innovative expansion of the
                    understanding of 'wellbeing' in ancient Greece.

                The modern concept of well-being encompasses a variety of
                elements that contribute to the improvement of an individual's
                quality of life. Beyond physical health, mental well-being,
                emotional stability, and job satisfaction are recognized as
                important components. Mental well-being refers to the ability to
                manage stress and adapt to changes, while emotional stability
                represents the capacity to navigate life's emotional ups and
                downs. Furthermore, job satisfaction indicates the sense of
                fulfillment and achievement derived from one's profession.

            Social connectivity, intellectual development, and environmental

            denotes continuous learning and personal growth. Lastly,
            environmental well-being pertains to living in a healthy and safe
            environment, which significantly impacts our physical and mental
            well-being. All these elements constitute the modern understanding
